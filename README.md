A 2D stealth game of wits and reflexes. You're locked in a grocery store overnight and a boogey monster is hunting you. Can you survive until morning?

## Gameplay
The objective of Scary Grocery is to survive for five nights. You must navigate the dark aisles of the store, hiding from a relentless monster. Use the shelves and shadows to your advantage, but be carefulâ€”every sound you make could be your last.
